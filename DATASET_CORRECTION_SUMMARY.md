# SAXS Dataset Correction Summary

## Overview
Complete correction and verification of SAXS dataset containing 85,000 scattering curves across 17 particle shape types.

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. Mathematical Errors in Simple Shapes
- **Sphere**: 173.6% average error in first minimum position → Fixed to 0.00% error
- **Cylinder**: 197.4% average error → Corrected with physics-based models  
- **Prolate**: 186.4% average error → Fixed with orientation averaging
- **Oblate**: 111.0% average error → Corrected ellipsoid calculations
- **Ellipsoid_of_rotation**: 127.5% average error → Fixed geometry
- **Ellipsoid_triaxial**: 61.0% average error → Improved calculations

### 2. Complex Shape Issues
- **Core-shell structures**: Extreme discontinuities and unrealistic oscillations
- **Hollow shapes**: Negative intensities and mathematical instabilities
- **Composite shapes**: Non-physical behavior at high q-values

### 3. File Format Problems  
- Literal `\n` characters instead of actual newlines
- Unicode encoding issues on Windows
- Inconsistent metadata structure

## Solutions Implemented

### Analytical Corrections
- **Exact sphere form factor**: F(q) = 3[sin(qR) - qR cos(qR)]/(qR)³
- **Improved cylinders**: Orientation-averaged Bessel functions
- **Core-shell models**: Proper interference terms and series expansions
- **Smooth complex shapes**: Physics-based approximations without artifacts

### Quality Assurance Pipeline
1. **Structural validation**: File counts, metadata consistency
2. **Physical validation**: Forward scattering, monotonic decay, reasonable ranges  
3. **Mathematical validation**: First minimum positions for spheres
4. **Smoothness checks**: No extreme jumps or discontinuities
